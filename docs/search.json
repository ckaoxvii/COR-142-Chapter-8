But how do we do that in a systematically to make sure that we are using data and logic rather than just our gut feelings? This is where hypothesis testing comes in!\nIn its broadest sense, hypothesis testing is a method of making decisions (like deciding whether the coin rigged and your neighbor full of üí©) using data. These decisions are made by comparing what we actually observe with what we would expect to find if a specific hypothesis (a fancy word for assumption) were true.\nWhen you hear people use the catch phrase data-driven decision-making, they are often referring to hypothesis testing.\nIn every hypothesis test, we have two competing scenarios: A scenario where how things should be in a normal, ideal world where everything is fair, and second scenario where things are different from the ideal world. The normal, ideal world scenario is called the null hypothesis (denoted by the symbol \\(H_0\\)), while the alternative scenario is called the alternative hypothesis (denoted by the symbol \\(H_a\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe ‚úã Game, Revisited\n\n\n\nIn the ‚úã game, we suspected that the coin is an unfair one. In an normal, ideal world, we expect the proportion of a coin landing on tails to be \\(0.5\\). An unfair coin would have a proportion of tails different from \\(0.5\\).\nWe can symbolically represent our two competing scenarios as follows: Let \\(p\\) be the proportion of tails when the coin is tossed.\n\nNull hypothesis: \\(H_0: p = 0.5\\)\nAlternative hypothesis: \\(H_a: p \\ne 0.5\\)\n\nLet‚Äôs take a moment to look at the alternative hypothesis. Saying that \\(p \\ne 0.5\\) means that the proportion of tails is not \\(0.5\\). This means that \\(p\\) is either greater than \\(0.5\\) (\\(p &gt; 0.5\\)), or \\(p\\) is less than \\(0.5\\) (\\(p &lt; 0.5\\)).\n\\(p \\ne 0.5\\) doesn‚Äôt quite fit the scenario from the ‚úã game, because no one would forget being slapped in the face 9 consecutive times. In this case, our suspicion is that the coin lands on tails more often than expected.\nSo, the appropriate alternative hypothesis should be \\(p &gt; 0.5\\).\nLet‚Äôs reframe the alternative hypothesis to better reflect the scenario from the ‚úã game:\n\n\\(H_0: p = 0.5\\)\n\\(H_a: p &gt; 0.5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 8.1.1.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nSuppose the proportion of all Flagler students who eat at DHall at least once a day was 60% last school year. The DHall service provider, Aramark, wants to know whether this proportion has changed this year. Help the manager formulate the null and alternative hypotheses for hypothesis testing.\n\n\nThe proportion from last year is \\(p = 0.6\\), which serves as the null hypothesis. The question we want to answer is whether this proportion has changed. In other words, \\(p \\ne 0.6\\). Therefore, the hypotheses are:\n\n\\(H_0: p = 0.6\\)\n\\(H_a: p \\ne 0.6\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 8.1.2.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion.Answer.\n\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by the University of Michigan, 71.5% of high school seniors in the U.S. had a driver‚Äôs license. A sociologist believes that this rate has declined. A sample of 500 randomly selected high school seniors finds that 350 of them had a driver‚Äôs license.\nWhat are the null and alternative hypotheses for testing the sociologist‚Äôs claim?\n\n\nThe proportion from the 2015 survey is \\(p = 0.715\\), which serves as the null hypothesis. The sociologist believes that this rate has declined, which means that \\(p &lt; 0.715\\). Therefore, the hypotheses are:\n\n\\(H_0: p = 0.715\\)\n\\(H_a: p &lt; 0.715\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above few examples, we can see that the null hypothesis is always an equality statement (e.g., \\(p = 0.5\\), \\(p = 0.6\\), \\(p = 0.715\\)), while the alternative hypothesis is always an inequality statement (e.g., \\(p \\ne 0.5\\), \\(p &gt; 0.5\\), \\(p &lt; 0.715\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nThe null hypothesis always contains an equality sign (‚Äú\\(=\\)‚Äù).\nAn alternative hypothesis with a ‚Äú\\(&lt;\\)‚Äù or ‚Äú\\(&gt;\\)‚Äù is called a one-sided hypothesis or one-tailed hypothesis.\nAn alternative hypothesis with a ‚Äú\\(\\ne\\)‚Äù is called a two-sided hypothesis or two-tailed hypothesis.\nWe use \\(p_0\\) to denote the hypothesized population proportion under the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Sided\nOne-Sided (Left)\nOne-Sided (Right)\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis\n\\(H_0: p = p_0\\)\n\\(H_0: p = p_0\\)\n\\(H_0: p = p_0\\)\n\n\nAlternative Hypothesis\n\\(H_a: p \\ne p_0\\)\n\\(H_a: p &lt; p_0\\)\n\\(H_a: p &gt; p_0\\)"
